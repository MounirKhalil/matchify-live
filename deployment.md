# Deployment Information

## Platform

The **matchify** project is deployed on **Lovable.dev**.

## What is Lovable?

Lovable is a modern web development and deployment platform that enables rapid application deployment with zero-configuration infrastructure. It provides:

- **Instant Deployments** - Automatic deployments triggered by git push
- **Built-in CDN** - Global content delivery network for fast loading times
- **SSL Certificates** - Automatic HTTPS encryption for secure connections
- **Custom Domains** - Easy domain management and configuration
- **Production-Ready Infrastructure** - Scalable hosting optimized for web applications

## Custom Domain Configuration

We have configured our custom domain **matchify.live** directly from inside the Lovable platform. This allows our project to be accessible at:

**https://matchify.live**

The domain was added through Lovable's domain management interface, which automatically handles:
- DNS configuration
- SSL certificate provisioning
- CDN routing
- HTTPS redirects

## Deployment Architecture

- **Frontend Hosting:** Lovable.dev
- **Backend Infrastructure:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
- **Custom Domain:** matchify.live
- **SSL/TLS:** Automatically managed by Lovable

## Benefits of Using Lovable

1. **Zero Configuration** - No need to manually set up servers, CDN, or SSL
2. **Automatic Deployments** - Code changes are deployed instantly on push
3. **Scalability** - Infrastructure automatically scales with traffic
4. **Developer Friendly** - Simple interface for domain and deployment management
5. **Production Ready** - Built-in best practices for security and performance
